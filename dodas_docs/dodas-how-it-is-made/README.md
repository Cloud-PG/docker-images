# DODAS: How it is made

DODAS has a highly modular architecture and the workflows is **highly customisable.** This is extremely valuable for a user because is a key to the possibility of extending the already provided configuration with anything the user might need \(from software dependencies up to the integration of external services passing through the user tailored code management\)**.** This kind of flexibility is achieved thanks to the modularity of the overall system which is shortly described below.  
The major sub-services composing DODAS are:  the INDGO [Identity and Access Management](https://indigo-iam.github.io/docs/v/current/) \(IAM\) and [Token Translation Service](https://legacy.gitbook.com/book/indigo-dc/wattson/details) \(TTS\), [PaaS Orchestrator](https://legacy.gitbook.com/book/indigo-dc/indigo-paas-orchestrator/details) and [Infrastructure Manager](http://imdocs.readthedocs.io/) \(IM\). Those composition of services represents the so called **PaaS Core Services** of DODAS.  
IAM is the OpenidConnect Authorization Server which has the crucial role to **authenticate the user** and to provide her/him with a OIDC token which in turn is used to delegate service to act on behalf of the user itself. While the user must register to the IAM-DODAS instance, a federated system supporting eduGAIN, the PaaS Orchestrator and/or IM are responsible to take care of the user request \(in form of a TOSCA template\) and prepare **a cluster for containers orchestration over the IaaS**. DODAS relies on Mesos for the container orchestration. The container orchestrator is meant as a layer where the end-users service can be executed as described more in detail [here](https://dodas.gitbook.io/dynamic-on-demand-analysis-service/~/edit/primary/dodas-how-it-is-made) and here.    
Regarding the PaaS Orchestrator and IM, both have the role of abstracting the underlying IaaSes and both of them support the same TOSCA language for input data description. There are differences among the two, and there are additional features \(with respect to the abstraction\) which are only supported by the PaaS Orchestrator. Concrete examples are:

* A user needs to hide a multi cloud environment, which in principle could be a combination of both public and private provider \(hybrid model\), in this case  the Orchestrator guarantee a transparent management of the underlying IaaSes
* A user needs support to the elasticity meant as an elastic extension of cluster based on load, the PaaS Orchestrator provides the proper support thanks to the integration with [Clues](https://legacy.gitbook.com/book/indigo-dc/clues-indigo/details). 

On the other hand is worth to mention that using your own public or private cloud through the orchestrator requires some [registration steps](https://dodas.gitbook.io/dynamic-on-demand-analysis-service/~/edit/drafts/-LEDKwAyU8rRIV1lDMsb/using-dodas-with-external-providers), while IM is not requiring any resource registration.
